is_started
A special template used to ask the game if it has begun. Until the game is confirmed to have
started, all commands are saved in the problem solver.

Control Templates:
These templates are the basis of valid messages.

condition
A pairing of a control template with an event template. The response should trigger ONCE upon an
event, trigger repeatedly WHILE an event occurs for the first time, trigger repeatedly UNTIL an
event occurs for the first time, or trigger IF the event ever occurs.

sequential
A pairing of a control template with another control template. The orders specified by the first
template should occur before the orders specified by the second template.

action
General class of templates that always involves a command to some unit or set of units
(commanded_unit).

Action Templates:
Inherit from the action template.

build
Required to specify which unit type to build, a quantity and a unit identifier. If the quantity is
x > 1, then it is assumed that the identifiers will be id, id + 1, id + 2....id + x - 1. Can
optionally which unit should build it. For buildings can optionally specify the location of a
building.

gather
Required to specify which resource resource type to gather. Optionally can specify which units or
set of units should perform the action.

move
Required to specify a location and which units should perform the action.

attack
Required to specify which units should perform the action as well as specifying a target, be it
units or a location.

defend
Required to specify which units should perform the action as well as specifying a target, be it
units or a location.

Event Templates:
event
General class of templates that always involves an attribute of the game state. A solitary event
template is not a valid message.

army
A template for the event of having a certain class of units in the army. It is required to specify
the units.

resources
A template for the event of having a certain resource state. It is required to specify the resource
type, a value for that resource and whether the comparator is greater, less or equal to the value.
A value of -1 for population refers to the maximum population. A value of -X for population refers
to X-1 less than the maximum population.

construction
A template for the event of having a completed constructing a certain unit. It is required to
specify the units and will typically do so via the unit identifier.


Descriptor Templates:
Templates for describing common bits of information used in other templates.

location
Required to specify the position relative to the landmark. Optionally specify a unit/building as a
landmark. If no landmark is given, then the user's mouse position will be used as the landmark.

units
Required to specify one of the fields. The quantity determines how many of the specified class of
units. A quantity of -1 means all units that match the class of units (could potentially be none).
The unit name provides a unique identifier to a completed unit. The unit identifier provides a
unique identification to a unit that is referred to elsewhere in the command. If the quantity is
x > 1, then it is assumed that the identifiers will be id, id + 1, id + 2....id + x - 1.
The identifier is assigned by the problem solver as needed. The location provides a location to find
the units. The unit status provides the current action of the unit. If unknown then status is set to
NA.
